# React, React Router V4, Webpack - Code Splitting
Simple example for creating code splitting using React Router V4
## Description
Since the deprecation of `System.import` by Webpack v3.x, the switch has been made to use [Dynamic Import](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import).
Using this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/acdlite/a68433004f9d6b4cbc83b5cc3990c194) by [Andrew Clark](https://github.com/acdlite) as inspiration I came up with this simple React app that uses React Router V4.x and Webpack 3.x to create the bundle files.
